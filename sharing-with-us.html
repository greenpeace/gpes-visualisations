            <h1>Sharing with us</h1>

            <p class="lead">If we are commissioning work in this area it should follow all the rules in this guide. This page is about using <u>materials that weren't made for us</u>. It can be a piece made by another NRO or made outside Greenpeace.</p>

            <p>Obviously the best way to share with us would be to follow all the recommendations in this guide. As this won't happen often, this page includes recommendations on how we can adapt and be able to use materials that were not made for us.</p>


            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h2>Copyright</h2>

                    <p>We should <strong>contact the authors</strong> of materials that we intend to use as soon as possible to get a confirmation on copyright restrictions and when possible to get their help on making their graphics look at their best in our website. </p>


                    <p>Ideally we should <strong>get permission</strong> from the authors to:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use</strong> the materials in our website and social media networks</li>
                        <li><strong>Translate</strong> the materials to other languages</li>
                        <li><strong>Modify</strong> the materials accordingly to our technical requierements and/or to contextualize</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Please note that often the data and the creative piece are under different licenses. Maybe in a specific case we can use the data, but not the creative piece.</p>

                    <p>And of course, we have an obligation to <strong>credit</strong> their work and link to the original when possible. We can do it as the examples in this guide:</p>

                    <p><small><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://es.greenpeace.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpeace</a> &bull; <strong>License:</strong> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Commons</a></small></p>

                    <p>Add a link to the original page as source and if the user is licencing the piece with an open license, we should also link to it.</p>

                    <p>Finally we should <strong>document</strong>, preferably in the source code or metadata, that they gave <strong>permission</strong> or that the pice was released under a <strong>permissive license</strong> and details about that license or permission. Don’t assume you can use it, always check and document the copyright status.</p>

                    <p>Please note: <a href="sharing.html#shareinfobox">infoboxes</a> can't be used unless the author has gaven permission to share with other sites as well, without asking.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h2>1. Infographics</h2>

                    <h3>File format</h3>

                    <p>For static infographics, <strong>vectorial formats</strong> are the best. Bitmap formats must be avoided. Also it’s much better if the infographic is <strong>editable</strong>, as we can fix problems.</p>

                    <p>The best is a well made <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scalable_Vector_Graphics&oldid=831566821" target="_blank">SVG</a></strong> that displays correctly in the major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge). Alternatively we can create SVGs from <strong>Adobe Illustrator <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adobe_Illustrator_Artwork&oldid=820090634">.ai</a></strong> files.</p>

                    <p>Always make sure that the <strong>fonts</strong> display well and that we can use them online. The font license must allow embedding and using it, or we'll be infringing copyright. Normally this is fine with Open Source fonts. Ideally we woud love to be able to change the font to one of our <a href="typography-and-colors.html">official fonts</a>.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes we may be able to hack a <strong>PDF file</strong> and extract a vectorial infographic from it. However most of the times it won’t work as well. It all depends on the tool that created the PDF and how that tool was configured. Just because it worked in a specific situation it doesn’t necessarily means it will work all the times. </p>

                    <h3>Sizes</h3>

                    <p>The minimum is to have a mobile/small format with around 480px wide and a medium format around 690px wide. Ideally also a large format around 1100px wide. The piece's height is not as important as long as the user can scroll and still understand the message.</p>

                    <p>If we have this two or three sizes and well build vectorial files, we probably can adapt them to our website. Please note this adaptations take time. Have the infographics available and time to adapt them with days in advance.</p>

                    <h2>2. Maps</h2>

                    <p>Most of the maps used in Spain are Google Maps.</p>

                    <h3>(Iframed) Google Maps</h3>

                    <p>This are the maps that you can create and keep in “Your places” in Google Maps. Iframed Google Maps are very popular and easy to use, however we must be aware of <strong>some issues</strong>:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>If the map is not in our account there's the risk that <strong>the owner can delete or modify it</strong>. In the long term the owner can update it and use it for a different purpose. And it's hard to track changes in Google Maps.</li>
                        <li>We can’t just copy and <strong>translate</strong> a map that is in someone else’s account. You must ask the owner to make a copy and give you ownership of that copy.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>You can ask the map author to <a href="https://www.igismap.com/create-save-export-download-kml-file-google-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">export a KML file from Google Maps</a> and use that file to render the map in our sites. The main advantage is that it’s easier to track changes by comparing the old and new KML files. Tracking changes is very important when translating maps.</p>

                    <h3>Other</h3>

                    <p>Latter we might add instructions to this guide on how to handle when someone shares a map with <strong>Mapbox</strong>, <strong>Cartodb</strong> or others.</p>

                    <h2>3. Videos</h2>

                    <p>Ideally we should try to obtain an <strong>editable HD video</strong>, or at least an <strong>MP4 HD video</strong> and permission to adapt it, if needed. We may need to add subtitles, voice over, adjust it and add to our Youtube and Facebook accounts. Being able to add it to our accounts will bring extra viewers and we can access the video's statistics.</p>

                    <h2>4. Charts</h2>

                    <p>For simple charts it’s easier to just <strong>recreate it from the original chart data</strong>. This way we ensure that's consistent with our design and all the other 5 core principles.</p>

                    <p>If applying the data to one of our charts takes too long, we should start assessing how feasible it is to <strong>adapt the chart to our design</strong>. Is it responsive? Is it readable in mobile? Is the library a known and documented open source library? Most popular open source chart libraries allow custom fonts and colors and work in well mobile, so normally this will be possible.</p>

                    <p>The worse cases is when we can’t neither recreate it from the original chart data or adapt the chart to our design. For example some commercial services can force us to create a paid account to prevent having ads or prevent us from using our fonts.</p>

                    <h2>5. Open, raw data</h2>

                    <p>We can open and use most types files used in open data. The main issue is how much work will it take to produce a chart from that data. Even when we already know what we’ll find and the chart we want to do, sometimes preparing that data may be time consuming.</p>

                    <h2>6. Interactive applications</h2>

                    <p>Using interactive web applications developed by others requires an analysis case by case. How dificult are they to adapt to our case, and can we do it ourselves? Do they look secure? Do they respect the user’ privacy? Can they be integrated in our site, or do they require a specific site? What are the server requirements? How hard are they to host and maintain? Do they require expensive licenses or access to APIs?</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>It’s very important to be able to <strong>talk with the original author</strong> about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>technical</strong> stuff. We should get in touch with him/her as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>On copyright, it’s important to get permissions to adjust the pieces, so we can get a good result.</p>

                    <p>When there's source files (for example with Illustrator pieces or video) it's much better if we have access to them. Often don't having access means low quality implementations in our site.</p>

                    <p>Always ensure the author you'll give him/her credit, and if you change the piece, it's a courtesy to show your changes before publising, explain why you did them and ask if they are OK with them.</p>
