            <h1>Sharing with others</h1>

            <p class="lead">There’s no universal way of sharing charts, maps and infographics that work well for all users and all materials. How we share each piece has to be analysed case by case. It’s not the reality we want but it’s the reality we have.</p>

            <p>In certain contexts we should share our charts, maps, infographics and data in <strong>different forms</strong>, so that they can be used in other sites, such as Greenpeace offices, other NGO, and media. Sometimes this sites need to <strong>translate</strong> or <strong>modify</strong> this pieces, for example to <strong>localise</strong>, <strong>contextualise</strong> or <strong>focus</strong> on a certain aspect or the graphic.</p>
            <p>How we share (technically) depends on the materials we want to share and with who we want to share with. Sometimes the best way to share with a site is not the best way to share with another. Having different options for the same piece helps that it spreads more. <strong>We should aim to have a system where the site can choose from different options</strong> and that it can do the entire process without contacting us or asking for our help. Some sites have tight deadlines and adding uncertainty and delays is not helpful for them. Contacting us should be an option, not a requirement when using our materials. </p>

Both documents contain <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong> requirements also followed in this guide.</p>

                    <h2>1. Static images</h2>

                    <p>In the past we have shared infographics and charts as static images, but static images:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Are <strong>not interactive</strong> and in many cases the lack of interactivity harms the user experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aren’t adaptable to different screen sizes</strong>, and that’s unacceptable in most cases. Sometimes a site manages to embed the images we send them, if the developers don’t get involved in the process of adapting the images it’s likely that the image quality will not be excellent. Maybe there’s problems just in some devices and screen sizes. At best the typographic and vector elements will be blurred.</li>
                        <li><strong>Are harder to change</strong>, and some sites may not like them as much as they might not comply with their graphic design rules. This issue can be minimised by giving them access to vectorial editable formats like .svg and .ai (Adobe Illustrator).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><a href="https://es.greenpeace.org/es/noticias/la-mancha-de-plasticos-del-pacifico-norte-triplica-ya-la-superficie-de-espana/" target="_blank">This image</a> was shared in a <a href="https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch-presskit/#&gid=2&pid=1" target="_blank">press area</a> by the Ocean Cleanup Foundation. As you can notice, both text and graphics are blurred and in mobile it's barely readable. We couldn't access the raw vectorial images, and there wasn't other bitmap versions of the same piece. There was little we could do in this case.</p>

                    <p>It’s possible to make graphics with static images that adjust to the user screen size but you need specific image sizes and specific html code for each site. It’s not feasible that we create this images as it’s time consuming and we don’t have access to the site’s backend to test.</p>

                    <p><strong>Our site</strong> is visited by large percentages of users with screen sizes between 320 x 450 and 1920 x 1080 and some of this users will have screens with higher pixel density. It’s fundamental that all users can see the graphics as good as possible. The <a href="sizes-formats-files.html"><strong>page about infographics size</strong></a> informs about image sizes for our website and magazine and the formats we should use. If we follow it’s recommendations we can publish high quality infographics.</p>

                    <p>If we want to publish an infographic in <strong>Facebook or Twitter</strong> we need to create an image optimised for this social networks. This image will likely be less informative as it’s main goal is to stand out and invite the user to click.</p>

                    <p>As of August 2018, we've obtained decent results with 491 x 506 sized images for <strong>Twitter</strong> and 500 x 516 for <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>2. Videos</h2>

                    <p>Technically videos, specially Youtube videos, work well in all websites and most social networks. While some sites block some types of external content, they generally allow posting simple videos in Youtube.</p>

                    <p>Html5 videos (not hosted in Youtube) are also well supported. Video-based interactives, using Youtube or not, are not that well supported: they have the same limitations as the charts.</p>

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h2>3. Iframes or packed javascript</h2>

                    <p>With this two techniques we are sharing, with other sites, <strong>fully interactive and responsive pieces</strong>, just like they appear in our website.</p>

                    <h3>Technique A - Iframes to embedded in the site</h3>

                    <p>With this technique we insert the graphic in the page by using an iframe. Websites can add the piece to their site just like a Youtube video.</p>

                    <p>Iframes are easier for the sites with less technical skills but some graphics will cause problems when used with this technique. Besides some content farms will limit the use of external contents, including iframed content.</p>

                    <p>And sites with technical skills may want to edit the graphic using the next technique, so we’ll look into the iframe option case by case and always as another alternative rather than the only alternative.</p>

                    <!-- PRINCIPIO -->
                    <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 68%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='iframe-chartsjs-in.html' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                    <!-- FIN -->

                    <p>Code to share the graphic above:</p>

                    <div style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
                    <code style="display: block;">&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 68%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class='embed-container'&gt;&lt;iframe src='https://apps.greenpeace.es/data-vis/iframe-chartsjs-in.html' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                    </div>

                    <p>Although this code should work in all websites, it wont because of technical choices made by the content farms owners. For example Wordpress.com does not allow the use of iframes in biogs hosted in Wordpress. However this code will work in a Wordpress site that’s not hosted in a content farm like <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>.</p>

                    <p>Also this graph will work in  <a href="https://www.blogger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a> but will not work in <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>, as it has serious limitations on external content.</p>

                    <h3>Technique B - Packed HTML + Javascript</h3>

                    <p>The Spanish office is testing easy to use HTML + Javascript instead of iframes. If it works and if it has enough support, website editors can easily insert our charts and infographics in their websites and the piece will adjust automatically to the site's layout. To add an infographic you just need to add a code like:</p>

                    <code style="display: block;">
                    &lt;div id="infoContainer" style="width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
                    &lt;script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gpes-static/pozos/pozos.min.js" type="application/javascript" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                    </code>

                    <p>Javascript has some of the compatibility problems and it’s less trustworthy than iframes. It also needs to be carefully coded to prevent it from interfering with the site’s functionality: we can't fully test the code because we don't know where it's going to be used.</p>

                    <p>But Javascript can also work better than iframes for some pieces. At the moment we are testing it with <a href="infograph.html">infographics</a> and:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>It works in</strong> Greenwire, Blogger, Wordpress...</li>
                        <li><strong>It doesn't work in</strong> Wordpress.com, Medium...</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h2>4. Share the (editable) code</h2>

                    <p>With this technique we share the code and data to reproduce the piece in another site. We do it using tools and techniques that make it <strong>easy for a beginner web developer to copy and adjust the code to their site</strong>. With this technique each site can easily adjust the fonts, colors and other design elements so that the graph integrates with their pages.</p>

                    <p>IMPORTANT: This is also the best way to share pieces to <strong>translate and adjust</strong> by other <strong>Greenpeace offices</strong>. Offices will be able to translate, localise, adjust or remix as they want.</p>

                    <p>There’s many <strong>tools</strong> that help sharing the code and make it easier to translate, localise, adjust and remix. We have chosen:</p>

                            <h3>Tool A - Codepen</h3>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://codepen.io/osvaldo/details/KZqPEK" target="_blank">

                                </a>
                            </p>
                            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Codepen</a> is a great tool to create a corporate profile and <strong>publicly present</strong> the final version of all materials that we have made. We can even create a blog with all graphics we have published. At the moment we are not using it, we are using Jsfiddle instead.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm">
                            <h3>Tool B - Jsfiddle</h3>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/osvik/j9kbu6wp/embedded/result,html/" target="_blank">

                            <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Jsfiddle</a> is a codepen alternative, easier to use and with an important feature that’s very helpful when developing or translating: <strong>version control</strong>. Version control is fundamental to experiment and be able to go back to previously saved versions. Besides in Jsfiddle the pieces are <strong>not public</strong> until you want them to be. </p>

                            <p>To better use this tool each user should create it’s own free account and use it to clone, modify and share it’s own graphics. <strong>We are already using Jsfiddle</strong>.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Tool C - Github</h3>

                    <p>Github is the most popular site to share code, collaborate and version control. Github is also used by many data journalists, analysts and data scientists. Some examples of data journalism related accounts: <a href="https://github.com/guardian" target="_blank">Guardian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wpinvestigative" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/" target="_blank">Five Thirty Eight</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TheUpshot">NY Times</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/civio">Civio (Spanish)</a>. See also the <a href="https://github.com/collections/open-journalism" target="_blank">Github's collection on open journalism</a>...</p>

                    <p>In Greenpeace we use Github globally with a <a href="https://github.com/greenpeace">shared account</a> with more than 150 repositories from a few NROs. 15 of those repositories are maintained by the Spanish Office. There's also a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/greenpeace/teams/gpes">Github team for the Spanish Office</a>.</p>

                    <p>The first data repository owned by the Spanish office in Github is the translation to English of the Spanish Weapons export map. The translations made by a professional translator that worked directly in the <a href="https://github.com/greenpeace/gpes-weapons-export-spain" target="_blank">private repository</a> and seeing his updates in a <a target="_blank" href="https://greenpeace.github.io/gpes-weapons-export-spain/">web page</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Latter, three translators edited html to translate an interactive about alternative energy projects. They also worked in a common private Github repository.</p>

                    <p><strong>In the future we’ll use Github to:</strong></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Translation of interactive apps - We are already doing it (2 pieces and 4 translators involved)</li>
                        <li>Share raw data and colaborate in open investigations.</li>
                        <li>Share and collaborate in interactive data visualisation projects.</li>
                    </ol>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>5. Share data in a standard format</h2>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm">
                    <p>With this technique we share the data in a standard plug-n-play format, and it’s up to the site to decide the tool used to show it to their users. It’s what we do with videos: we send them .mp4 files and it’s up to each site to decide on how they want to present it.</p>

                    <p>The main problem is that there aren’t any plug-n-play standard data formats. With maps there’s <strong>GeoJson</strong> and <strong>KML</strong> but not for other data types.</p>

            <h2>6. Share also raw data (open data)</h2>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm col-md-6">

                    <p>For certain specific audiences it’s very important to share the raw data (if confirmed and if the data license allows it) used to prepare the data used in the graphic. With access to the raw data other people can study it with another perspective and make alternative visualisations. It’s also a way to be transparent and open to scrutiny. Generally it will add credibility to our findings.</p>

                    <p>In certain pages we should add a preview of the data, links to the files in one or more formats and information about authors and license.</p>

                    <p>When we share raw data we should make an effort to make it understandable by others and facilitate downloads in open formats.</p>

                    <p>To host and preview raw data in our websites we have chosen <strong>Google Drive</strong> with Team Drives. It’s a system that we already use, and although it’s not open source, it allows exporting data to many open formats. Google Drive is easy to use and to update the data.</p>

                    <h2>Use of commercial products</h2>

                    <p>Charts produced with commercial products like Tableau have their advantages and disadvantages, with differences from brand to brand. There’s dozens of services and it’s hard to make comments that apply to all of them but generally:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The site that receives the chart from us must create an account on the same site, if it wants to translate or adapt the chart. Maybe at first of for small amounts of traffic it’s free, but it’s likely that they have to <strong>switch to a paid account</strong>. And paid accounts need to be maintained: invoices, permission levels, user accounts, who can have access to the backend…</li>
                        <li>Most if not all sites do not facilitate the <strong>transfer of charts/maps</strong> between accounts. That implies that to have an editable copy of the original chart they have to recreate it from the available data, definitely a time consuming task.</li>
                        <li>Professional and flexible products aren’t easy to use and must be <strong>learned</strong>. They need to spend a lot of time learning the basics of the product just to make a small adjustment.</li>
                        <li>Even if they don’t want to change or translate the graphic, some sites might not want to have in their pages <strong>content that’s not on their own accounts</strong>. Maybe there’s an internal policy against that or they fear that the graphic is changed or deleted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Yes, some sites this use commercial products, but their needs, skills and organisational structure are different from our own. Their products are slightly <strong>easier to start with but harder to progress</strong>.</p>
                    <p>And for us it would mean keep paying for services that we don't use anymore, just to maintain the charts online.</p>
